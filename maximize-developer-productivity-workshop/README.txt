Lab exercises are located in the following folders:

 * labs/01-local-cache
 * labs/03-build-comparison
 * labs/04-troubleshooting-with-build-scans

Lab 1,3, and 5 include variations for both Gradle and Maven users. See the "gradle" or "maven" folder inside each lab according to which build tool you wish to use to complete the lab.

Each lab contains a README.txt file with instructions for completing the lab and a SOLUTIONS.txt file to refer to if you get stuck.

If you have problems running the builds locally, each lab has a link to an example scan you can use instead. Look for `e.g. https://go.gradle.com/wb-ch3-g1` below each instruction.

The instructions for labs #2, #5, #6, #7, #8 are in text on the slides.
