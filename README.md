# Gradle Training Material

Introduction to Gradle is aimed at developers and build masters who have no previous experience with Gradle. It is designed to give you a foundation in Gradle fundamentals. We assume you have some familiarity with the Java programming language and some experience with automated builds.

Our goal is to demonstrate the building blocks necessary for you to author your own build scripts. This class is hands-on, so you will spend a significant portion of the class with your hands on the keyboard, learning by doing, working through lab exercises. By the end of this class, you will know the basics of Gradle and have a feel for how Gradle tasks and build scripts work.

The Gradle build cache significantly reduces build time by reusing outputs produced by other builds in your organization. In this training, you will learn the basics and best practices to make the most of caching in your build. Discussion about the different possible architectures, how they affect build performance, and how Gradle Enterprise can help you manage, analyze, and troubleshoot the build cache.
